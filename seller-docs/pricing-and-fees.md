# Pricing and Fees

With Digimaly, there is no monthly fee, and no setup fees. However, there are a few fees that you should be aware of.

## Platform (Transaction) Fees

With Digimaly, there is a 10% flat transaction fee on all items, commissions, and subscriptions. Once a transaction is complete, the seller will receive 90% of the total amount paid by the buyer.

Once you have earned at least $500 in sales, you will be eligible for a reduced transaction fee of 5%.

## Payment Processing Fees

Digimaly uses Stripe to process all payments. This fee is deducted from the platform fee, and is not passed on to the seller. This means that you will receive the full amount of the transaction minus the platform fee. 

## Payout Fees

There is no fee for payouts done automatically or manually to your bank account. However, if you want to receive your payout faster directly to a debit card, there is a 10% fee per fast payout.

Note that fast payouts are only available to sellers in the United States as of now.

## Refunds

If a buyer requests a refund, we will make a decision based on the circumstances. If the refund is found to be reasonable, we will deduct the amount of the refund (not including platform fee) from your platform balance. If you do not have enough funds in your platform balance, your account balance will be negative. You will be required to pay back the negative balance or have enough sales to cover the negative balance before you can receive any payouts.

If you do not agree with the refund, you can appeal the decision. If the appeal is successful, we will refund the buyer, and we will make sure that the money from that refund is returned back to you.

If the refund is found to be unreasonable by us from the beginning, we will refund the buyer depending on the circumstances. You will not be required to pay back the negative balance.

## Chargebacks

If we receive a chargeback from the buyer, we will dispute the chargeback on your behalf. If the chargeback is not found in your favor, we will deduct the amount of the chargeback (not including platform fee) from your platform balance. If you do not have enough funds in your platform balance, your account balance will be negative. You will be required to pay back the negative balance or have enough sales to cover the negative balance before you can receive any payouts. 

If you want to appeal the chargeback, you can do so by contacting us. If the appeal is successful, we will refund the amount back to you.
